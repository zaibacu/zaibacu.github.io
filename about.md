Doing Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Generation, and some coding in general. Usually love to tinker with infrastructure.
Training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (Since 2016) and casually running some half-marathons (full marathon some day, hopefully).

### My Projects

- [Rita DSL](https://github.com/zaibacu/rita-dsl) - A Domain Specific Language created for writing rules which allows to parse information from text

- [Oshino](https://github.com/CodersOfTheNight/oshino) - Metrics collector designed to work together with [Riemann](http://riemann.io/)
